            <p>My name is Yordanos Zegeye.<br /> 
                I'm named after the holiest river in the world located in Jerusalem. Industrious,enjoyabel and athletic, these three words describe me more that any other words or sentences. I was born in a city called Bahirdar but spent most of my life in Addis. I am a 3<sup>rd</sup> year Software Enginnering student at AAiT, just like i used to wish when i was a kid.<br />
                Down I have tried to tell something about my hobbies.

            <p>As any kid who grew up in Ethiopia i am deeply affiliated to football. It is the one of the best activities i prefer to do during my lesiure time.
                I usually play as a striker and as a midfielder. Football has taught me alot in life; i have learnt team-work, how to wisely handel both my success and failure and many other lessons.

            <p> I have finished highschool in St. Joseph School Addis Ababa. And as an SJS student it is nearly impossible not to play basketball during ur stay at the school. I started playing basketball while i joined the junior school and developed it through out the whole highschool years.Eventhough i don't have the averahe height of a basketball player, i really do enjoy playing the game. And it is will always be one of my favourite hobbies. </p>
