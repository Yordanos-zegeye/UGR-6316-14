                    I'm named after the holiest river in the world located in Jerusalem. Industrious, enjoyable, and athletic, these three words describe me more than any other words or sentences. I was born in a city called Bahirdar but spent most of my life in Addis. I am a 3<sup>rd</sup> year Software Engineering student at AAiT, just like I used to wish when I was a kid.<br />
                    Down below, I have tried to tell something about my hobbies.

                <p class="about__football-text">As any kid who grew up in Ethiopia, I am deeply affiliated with football. It is one of the best activities I prefer to do during my leisure time.
                    I usually play as a striker and as a midfielder. Football has taught me a lot in life; I have learned teamwork, how to wisely handle both my success and failure, and many other lessons.

                <p class="about__basketball-text">I have finished high school in St. Joseph School Addis Ababa. And as an SJS student, it is nearly impossible not to play basketball during your stay at the school. I started playing basketball while I joined the junior school and developed it throughout the whole high school years. Even though I don't have the average height of a basketball player, I really do enjoy playing the game. And it will always be one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
