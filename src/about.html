                        I'm named after the holiest river in the world located in Jerusalem. Industrious, enjoyable,
                        and athletic, these three words describe me more than any other words or sentences. I was born
                        in a city called Bahirdar but spent most of my life in Addis. I am a 3<sup>rd</sup> year
                        Software Engineering student at AAiT, just like I used to wish when I was a kid.<br />
                        Down I have tried to tell something about my hobbies.

                    <p class="mb-4">As any kid who grew up in Ethiopia, I am deeply affiliated with football. It is one
                        of the best activities I prefer to do during my leisure time. I usually play as a striker and as
                        a midfielder. Football has taught me a lot in life; I have learned teamwork, how to wisely
                        handle both my success and failure, and many other lessons.

                    <p class="mb-4">I have finished high school in St. Joseph School Addis Ababa. And as an SJS student,
                        it is nearly impossible not to play basketball during your stay at the school. I started playing
                        basketball while I joined the junior school and developed it throughout the whole high school
                        years. Even though I don't have the average height of a basketball player, I really do enjoy
                        playing the game. And it will always be one of my favorite hobbies.

                    <p class="text-white mb-4">I love saving the moments in any way I can. Thankfully, photographs are
                        by far the best method ever. Even though I'm not a professional photographer, I take some
                        pictures that are sometimes found very pleasant by my friends. And I would like to share them
                        with you here.
