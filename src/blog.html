            <h2 class="h1 mt-5">Are Humans Rational Animals?</h2>
            <p class="lead mt-5">“Humans are rational animals”, said Aristotle. But based on reality, are we really rational; are all humans rational? This a concept that usually puts me in a dilemma with myself. I used to believe that all humans are rational and everyone can consider an event from various angles and make a decision that benefits all. Unfortunately, as I get mature and start to see the world from new perspective, I have questioned the “Rationality” of us. <br/>
                <br/>
                Before deciding whether humans are rational or not, we have to define the word rationality properly. Cambridge dictionary defined the word rationality as “ the quality of being based on clear thought and reason, or of making decisions based on clear thought and reason.” Now upon this definition let's evaluate human being's rationality. I want to focus on the two words <q>clear thought</q> and <q>reason</q>, since these are the criteria we are going to use to evaluate our acts.<br/>
                <br/>
                The first condition that needs to be fulfilled in order to be called rational , is the ability to think clearly. It is the state of acting intelligently and not being mentally confused. Someone must be able to evaluate circumstances independent from confusion led by the influence of the others. Independent from every external influences that are capable of redirecting our decisions that are originally generated from our inner self.<br/>
                <br/>
                If we humans are to be called rational, our brain must calculate every variable on its own from past learning. But in my opinion, this does not hold true; of all examples we can mention, for now let's take Mob Mentality as a counter example to disprove the rationality of humans. “Mob Mentality is the inclination that some humans have to be part of a large group, usually neglecting their individual feelings in the process.” Frequently we have seen politicians and many other individuals use mob mentality as an instrument to mobilize people either for bad or good intentions. In my own word, when someone is part of a mob and is being led by a single person, then that person is <q>renting</q> himself to that single person. The one who is leading the mob will have the power to control every individual's decisions and actions. The main reason why people fall into mob mentality is <q>emotion</q>, because being a part of a group promises heightened emotional states. We all agree on the fact that rationality and emotions are two irreconcilable concepts, since our emotions will totally switch of our logical reasoning.<br/>
                <br/>
                The other factor that needs to be considered in order label someone as rational is its ability to reason while trying to make decisions. The word reasoning is the process of reaching a conclusion or a decision through the intellect cognition of reasons. Hence, for a reasonable or logical conclusion to be drawn, someone must be able to think every possible variable carefully and then reach the conclusion.<br/>
                <br/>
                The best example to illustrate that we humans are not rational, is when we are in different kinds of emotions. Although emotions are not always with us, we cannot deny the fact that we are usually controlled by our emotions. Fear, love, anxiety, excitement, anger, boredom and all the other emotions known so mimic a very crucial role in our decision making process. Specially, if we are experiencing negative emotions, then our decisions will be forwarded  mainly for the instant relieve of that emotion; we won't consider what our actions may be, which is why people mostly make silly mistakes.<br/>
                <br/>
                I will close my argument with the following quote, <blockquote> <p> Man is a rational animal — so at least I have been told. Throughout a long life I have looked diligently for evidence in favor of this statement, but so far I have not had the good fortune to come across it.</p><footer> —Bertrand Russell, <cite>An Outline of Intellectual Rubbish. </cite></footer></blockquote>
